# Frontend mentor- Clipboard Landing Page Solution
This is a solution to the [clipboard landing page challenge on frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9/hub)

## Overview
### The challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process:
The first thing I did was to study the design templates provided alongside the challenge and tried to understand what was required in the challenge. Through that, I was able to come up with a plan on how to go about it.

### Built with:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
